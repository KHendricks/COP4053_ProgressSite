							<h2>Week One : 21 - September - 2018</h2>
							<p>
This week we presented our project presentation in lecture and resulting from that we were able to get a direction for where we wanted to go with the project for the next few weeks, and that is to focus on setting up the foundation of the game and establishing a playable tutorial. James began working on the tutorial, setting wise and mechanic wise, so it will be primed and ready for the first playable demo presentation. Faye ported in the character assets and set up basic controls. Kyle fine-tuned the controls of the character of the scene to allow everything mesh together properly. Leading up to the day of the project there have been numerous implementations of features by the group. James created few examples of 3D voxel art for the project to potentially use as characters/npcs in the game, he also added sprinting and began creating jumping mechanics for the player character and pulled in a bunch of 3D assets to allow the team to begin building the framework of the game. James is now currently working on setting up the tutorial mode for the first playable demo. Faye has been focused mainly on setting up a foundation of a level and that includes her art and animations focus of the project. She created a 3D desert/mountainous terrain in Blender and pulled that into the game and added collision detections between the player and the map, she created a 2D player character with eight sides as to allow the character to feel as if its 3D to give the game a unique 2.5D feel, she is currently working on getting the character to animate properly based on the movement input. Kyle set up a mock level with basic mechanics such as player movement, and an AI follower control for the dogs in the game. These scripts were fundamental but gave a baseline as to what to work on for the group. He additionally fine-tuned James jumping mechanic for the player and added a Raycast aimed downwards to the ground to ensure the player can only jump when in contact with the ground. Kyle is currently working on setting up ranged weapons to use in the game such as a slingshot and boomerang. In addition to working on the gamel, the team also agreed to use GitHub for version control and have the repository for the project <a href="https://github.com/KHendricks/COP4053_Project"> here</a>. Kyle created a prototype for a main menu to get the ball rolling for the project and to provide a foundation for the group to work on. Lastly, the repository for the website is hosted on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/KHendricks/COP4053_ProgressSite">here</a>. By using GitHub to host the website, it allows for a timeline display to see how frequently updates were pushed to the website for verification of the progress.

							<h2>Week Two : 28 - September - 2018</h2>
							<p>
								This week was a quite a productive week for the group. Each member has branched off into their own specific partition of the project to allow everything to come together for the first playable presentation on October 25th.
							</p>
							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								Faye has done an incredible amount of work this week. Faye was able to get the 2D player character to animate properly in the 3D environment and placed an immovable enemy in the scene to allow a foundation for the enemy mechanics to have a noticeable impact. In addition to that, she began working on properly animating the dog to follow the player. She utilized Kyle’s Dog Follow script and made a few modifications to smooth things out within the script and placed that on the dog game object to follow the player around. Faye is currently working on fixing the animations for the dog as the approach taken to animating the player based on the direction is not applicable towards the dog and has to come up with a different approach.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James has jumped right into the storyboard to the overall game and is working on a proper foundation for the tutorial level. James’ current focus towards the project is to make the game feel fun for the play, and as mentioned in the lecture this is no simple task. There are a lot of factors to take into account such as difficulty, time management, uniqueness and a lot of other aspects. Right now, James is working on developing an intrinsic story to pull the player in and allow them to immerse themselves into the elements of the game.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle is currently working an inventory system for the game. Before the idea of the inventory system came about, Kyle was planning on setting up multiple weapons, but the group realized that if multiple weapons were developed without a proper management system in place it could pose a challenge to make adjustments in regard to that. So before the weapons are developed, Kyle is currently working on an inventory system for the player to be able to properly manage the variety of weapons, such as knives, boomerangs, and slingshot.

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Week Three : 5 - October - 2018</h2>
							<p>
								This week each member has diverted more into their tasks but with some overlap based on each team member’s specialties. 							</p>
							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								This week Faye has smoothed out the enemy animation and worked on the dog AI to get it to face the proper direction of the player. Faye asked for Kyle’s help in working on the dog’s direction in matching the player. Faye is also working on animations for the weapons in the inventory system and is now in the process of drafting up those animations and implementing them into the project.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James added controller support for the player by enabling jumping, and inventory cycling through a controller, more specifically through an Xbox One controller. James also set up a Trello board to help keep the team organized by allowing the team to visually see the divided-up tasks that are currently being worked on.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle set up an inventory system in the game to hold the varying weapons in the game, fixed the direction the dog would be facing in regard to the player by manually pulling the player’s direction variables and passing them to the dog, and set up fundamentals for a slingshot weapon with placeholder art.

							<h2>Week Four : 12 - October - 2018</h2>
							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								This week Faye has redesigned the playable level and remodeled assets to allow for an easier use of the mesh collider to set up the terrain properly. Faye created new foliage and rock prefabs to use in the game and set up the colliders to allow the player to properly navigate through the terrain. Faye is also working attack animations and cleaned up the assets within the project a bit for easier maneuverability.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James expanded on Faye’s work this week by fine-tuning the playable level and added some overall polish by fleshing out the terrain assets for the scenery. James is continuing maintaining controller support for the project with any new additional features as well.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle is continuing on working on the weapon and inventory system. With the basic HUD and player health set up he is currently working on giving the weapons their own damage values and usability.  Kyle is currently creating pickup scripts for the weapons to trigger them to toggle in the player’s inventory and is working on modifying the direction of the slingshot to match the player.

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Week Five : 19 - October - 2018</h2>
							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								This week Faye has been working on setting up state machines for the player, dog and enemies to allow an easier transition for the animations. In addition to this, Faye has built voxel art for the slingshot and knife weapons for the player, built a cage to hold the dog until the player comes to rescue the dog, and has been working on proper animations for the player when attacking. She decided to take a more universal approach to attack animations instead of creating differing animations for each weapon due to time constraints.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James has been working on the getting proper sound assets for the game, providing control support to any control scheme updates, fine-tuning the scenery display and is focusing on the level design. Currently the development is occurring on a test level and James is working on developing a tutorial level.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle has been focusing on finishing up the weapon system. Due to input from Faye, Kyle adjusted the size of the inventory from five weapons down to three to reduce the art overhead that would have resulted from having five weapons. Kyle added an ammo system for the slingshot weapon, adjusted the player’s health style and instead of a numerical display, it is now a Zelda style heart system, created a generic enemy drops script to attach to all enemy types to determine if an enemy is to drop a specific item.

							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James is currently working on the soundboard for the game, he has added slingshot sounds and has pulled in quite a few assets for sounds to allow Faye and Kyle to attach any sounds to objects as needed.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle is currently fine-tuning the weapon system for the demo day. Specifically, Kyle is working on getting both the slingshot and knife objects to look less awkward with their positioning when selected through the inventroy and is working on an attack method for the knife.

							<h2>Week Seven : 2 - November - 2018</h2>

							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								This week Faye has worked on the message popup display, new user interface art, animations, fleshed out the level design, established a method to enable the enemy to attack, and enabled/disabled the dog to follow the player when crossing a bridge. The context display is currently a work in progress as there are some bugs with it displaying properly and she is currently working on fixing that as well as getting the treasure chest to work properly for the game mechanics.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James has been working on the soundboard for the game, there were some complications with conflicts with using Github and his changes were repressed in favor of some changes Faye made, so James is currently working on getting the sounds re-implemented while working around the conflicts.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle has fine-tuned the weapons system to a more appropriate level from the first playable. The weapons display for a couple seconds once the player attacks with the weapon in which the weapon will hide again after the time frame to allow the weapons to look less clumsy. Kyle implemented an attacking method for the knife, in which it acts similarly to the slingshot by firing an “invisible” projectile that disappears quickly after firing to allow for a “melee” range for the game, in addition to this Kyle enabled the player to be attacked by the enemy, lose health and established a lose condition.

							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								This week Faye has been focusing on overhauling the UI system to ensure the game looks visually polished and enticing to the players. She also refactored the input to be handled by an InputManager so all the keys are bound within a single file.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James is currently working on the collisions and asset handling. He is also in the process of finding usable sounds for the project to match with the theme.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle has been mainly focused on the weapon system in the game, currently he is setting up the weapons to appear when being used to attacked and is working on a new style of an inventory system after the critiques from the demo day. In addition to this, Kyle is also working on making attacks noticeable when the player or enemy is hit by a projectile.

							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								This week Faye has created artwork for button popups for the controller. Initially the artwork was for a GameCube controller, but it has been updated for artwork with an Xbox One controller. In addition to this, Faye is working on creating new assets for multiple levels now since the core components of the game have mostly been fleshed out.							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								This week James updated the controller support, fixed any bugs regarding controller input, and enabled the start screen, win screen, and lose screen buttons be pressed with a controller instead of a mouse click.							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								This week Kyle updated the inventory setting to allow the selector to not be able to scroll over empty inventory slots, and added a flashing hit indicator for enemy NPCs and the player to have a visual display when health was lost. Kyle is now currently working on figuring how to implement the final weapon in the game, the lasso.

							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								Faye has been working on the State machine for the game and adjusting anything in regard to that. Her next focus is to create artwork and mechanics for a wandering enemy to allow the game to have the two differing types of enemies envisioned. In addition to this, she discussed how to handle multiple levels in the game by having a main game scene and having different locations in the scenes for the levels.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James is currently updating controller supports and audio assets for the game to allow everything to fit into place.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								This week Kyle has been working on implementing the Lasso weapon for the game. He currently has it set up in the inventory system but is now working on mechanics for the lasso. The group has talked about having a grappling effect similar to the hookshot from The Legend of Zelda series for the lasso but that is still to be determined. In addition to this, Kyle has adjusted the projectile for the knife to make it feel more melee like and have a wider arc the damage in a cone in front of the player.

								This week Faye is finishing up the content for the game and she has fully implemented level 2, refactored the enemy scripts and added a dog “pack” system to allow the player to have an army of dogs following him which was envisioned at the start of the game.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James has finished up all the music and sound effects through the use of an audio manager and has set up a system in place for the audio manager to persist through scenes. The audio manages handles which sounds to play while the player and enemy scripts simply state to play a sound.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle has finished up the Lasso implementation and boss mechanics for the game. The lasso will pull the player a few units in front of him as long as there are no collisions in the way. The boss system has 4 main mechanics: a single shot, a multi shot, a barrage shot, and a chance to charge the player.

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Week Twelve : 5 - December - 2018</h2>
							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								For the last week of the project Faye has built and modeled the third level and the boss level to flesh out the content of the game. She built the levels manually, creating prefabs for environmental visuals to easily implement those into the scene. In addition to this, Faye has also set up a respawn system to allow the level to reload upon player death, added boss dialogue, and updates to the dog AI to allow more of a pack behavior. Faye modified Kyle’s wandering AI into a patrol AI for the enemies on the third level have them patrol between two selected locations instead of a random scenario. Since the completion of the project, Faye has been adding overall polish to the game such as adding a fade in black screen when loading the scene, and a final cutscene.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James has finished up the Audio for the game with the Audio manager he created. He finalized all the boss sound effects, movement sounds, hurt sounds, and menu music. In addition to this, James also kept controller support up to date with any change that happened during the development process, with a focus on using an Xbox One controller.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								For the final week Kyle removed the Lasso implementation he created and only used two weapons for the game the Slingshot and the Knife. The reason for this is that the slingshot and knife fulfilled both a close range and long-range combat scenario which felt adequate for the game and including the lasso would not have been needed for the style of the game. In addition to this, Kyle tweaked the boss mechanics from the previous week to attempt to ensure a more fun enjoyable experience for the play, the main feature tweaked was the barrage shot it originally shot 4 rocks out but now it is down to 3. For some quality of life features Kyle included debug keys for the final presentation in case any issues cropped up such as reloading a scene or giving the player full health.

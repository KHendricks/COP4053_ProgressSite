							<h2>Week One : 21 - September - 2018</h2>
							<p>
This week we presented our project presentation in lecture and resulting from that we were able to get a direction for where we wanted to go with the project for the next few weeks, and that is to focus on setting up the foundation of the game and establishing a playable tutorial. James began working on the tutorial, setting wise and mechanic wise, so it will be primed and ready for the first playable demo presentation. Faye ported in the character assets and set up basic controls. Kyle fine-tuned the controls of the character of the scene to allow everything mesh together properly. Leading up to the day of the project there have been numerous implementations of features by the group. James created few examples of 3D voxel art for the project to potentially use as characters/npcs in the game, he also added sprinting and began creating jumping mechanics for the player character and pulled in a bunch of 3D assets to allow the team to begin building the framework of the game. James is now currently working on setting up the tutorial mode for the first playable demo. Faye has been focused mainly on setting up a foundation of a level and that includes her art and animations focus of the project. She created a 3D desert/mountainous terrain in Blender and pulled that into the game and added collision detections between the player and the map, she created a 2D player character with eight sides as to allow the character to feel as if its 3D to give the game a unique 2.5D feel, she is currently working on getting the character to animate properly based on the movement input. Kyle set up a mock level with basic mechanics such as player movement, and an AI follower control for the dogs in the game. These scripts were fundamental but gave a baseline as to what to work on for the group. He additionally fine-tuned James jumping mechanic for the player and added a Raycast aimed downwards to the ground to ensure the player can only jump when in contact with the ground. Kyle is currently working on setting up ranged weapons to use in the game such as a slingshot and boomerang. In addition to working on the gamel, the team also agreed to use GitHub for version control and have the repository for the project <a href="https://github.com/KHendricks/COP4053_Project"> here</a>. Kyle created a prototype for a main menu to get the ball rolling for the project and to provide a foundation for the group to work on. Lastly, the repository for the website is hosted on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/KHendricks/COP4053_ProgressSite">here</a>. By using GitHub to host the website, it allows for a timeline display to see how frequently updates were pushed to the website for verification of the progress.

							<h2>Week Two : 28 - September - 2018</h2>
							<p>
								This week was a quite a productive week for the group. Each member has branched off into their own specific partition of the project to allow everything to come together for the first playable presentation on October 25th.
							</p>
							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								Faye has done an incredible amount of work this week. Faye was able to get the 2D player character to animate properly in the 3D environment and placed an immovable enemy in the scene to allow a foundation for the enemy mechanics to have a noticeable impact. In addition to that, she began working on properly animating the dog to follow the player. She utilized Kyle’s Dog Follow script and made a few modifications to smooth things out within the script and placed that on the dog game object to follow the player around. Faye is currently working on fixing the animations for the dog as the approach taken to animating the player based on the direction is not applicable towards the dog and has to come up with a different approach.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James has jumped right into the storyboard to the overall game and is working on a proper foundation for the tutorial level. James’ current focus towards the project is to make the game feel fun for the play, and as mentioned in the lecture this is no simple task. There are a lot of factors to take into account such as difficulty, time management, uniqueness and a lot of other aspects. Right now, James is working on developing an intrinsic story to pull the player in and allow them to immerse themselves into the elements of the game.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle is currently working an inventory system for the game. Before the idea of the inventory system came about, Kyle was planning on setting up multiple weapons, but the group realized that if multiple weapons were developed without a proper management system in place it could pose a challenge to make adjustments in regard to that. So before the weapons are developed, Kyle is currently working on an inventory system for the player to be able to properly manage the variety of weapons, such as knives, boomerangs, and slingshot.

						<div class="content">
							<h2>Week Three : 5 - October - 2018</h2>
							<p>
								This week each member has diverted more into their tasks but with some overlap based on each team member’s specialties. 							</p>
							<h3>Faye</h3>
							<p>
								This week Faye has smoothed out the enemy animation and worked on the dog AI to get it to face the proper direction of the player. Faye asked for Kyle’s help in working on the dog’s direction in matching the player. Faye is also working on animations for the weapons in the inventory system and is now in the process of drafting up those animations and implementing them into the project.
							</p>
							<h3>James</h3>
							<p>
								James added controller support for the player by enabling jumping, and inventory cycling through a controller, more specifically through an Xbox One controller. James also set up a Trello board to help keep the team organized by allowing the team to visually see the divided-up tasks that are currently being worked on.
							</p>
							<h3>Kyle</h3>
							<p>
								Kyle set up an inventory system in the game to hold the varying weapons in the game, fixed the direction the dog would be facing in regard to the player by manually pulling the player’s direction variables and passing them to the dog, and set up fundamentals for a slingshot weapon with placeholder art.
